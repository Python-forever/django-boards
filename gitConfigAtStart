Basic Setup
First thing, set your identity:

git config --global user.name "Vitor Freitas"
git config --global user.email vitor@simpleisbetterthancomplex.com


In the project root (the same directory as manage.py is), initialize a git repository:

git init
Output:Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/vitorfs/Development/myproject/.git/


Check the status of the repository:

git status

Output:

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

  accounts/
  boards/
  manage.py
  myproject/
  requirements.txt
  static/
  templates/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


.gitignore file:This file set regular expression for the file no need to configure in hgit repo

__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
.env
venv/


# SQLite database files

*.sqlite3


Now add the files to the repository:

git add .
Notice the dot here. The command above is telling Git to add all untracked files within the current directory.

Now make the first commit:

git commit -m "Initial commit"


Create an account in github with same username and email.
Now create a repository in git


Now configure the remote repository:
git remote add origin https://github.com/Python-forever/django-boards.git  #django-board is a repo taken as example


Now push the code to the remote server, that is, to the GitHub repository:
git push origin master
